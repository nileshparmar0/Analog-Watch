# Analog-Watch

Description:

This project implements a simple analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, and updates every second to reflect the correct time.

#How It Works:
• The HTML file sets up the structure of the clock, including the clock face and the three clock hands (hour, minute, second).
• The CSS file styles the clock, making it circular and positioning the clock hands correctly.
• The JavaScript file contains the logic to get the current time, convert it to the appropriate format, calculate the rotation degrees for each hand, and apply these rotations to the clock hands. This script runs continuously, updating every second to ensure the clock displays the current time accurately.
